# Fiber

Fiber is a framework Augur recognizes during deterministic analysis. Its semantic role is defined in `semantics.yaml`, and Phase 2 should treat detection as strong but revisable evidence when interpreting the architecture.

## Recognition
Use the framework reference in `references/frameworks/` as the canonical shared explanation and signatures source. Deterministic detector policy or rules, when present, live under `detectors/frameworks/fiber/`.

## Architectural implications
- framework scope: `backend`
- framework kind: `api-server`
- framework-native traits and relationships are defined in `semantics.yaml`

## Common failure modes
- handler-bloat
- middleware-ordering-surprises
- express-style-overuse
